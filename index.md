# üìö Critical Making Portfolio  
*Curated by Noor Aboushama*

Welcome to my final portfolio for this course on critical making. This collection reflects my creative inquiry into storytelling, identity, technology, and education. Each piece blends digital tools with personal exploration, drawing on both theory and lived experience.

Our course emphasized that making is more than doing ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **form of thinking**, of asking questions through design. As Johnson and Salter state in *Crafting Futures in the Age of AI*, ‚Äúcritical making is not about arriving at answers, but surfacing the systems that shape us.‚Äù This portfolio brings together those surfaced systems and questions, across several mediums and methods.

## üîπ 1. Reimagining the Self

**Prompt:** Create a visual narrative that explores identity, memory, and transformation using self-portraits and generative tools.

I began with a selfie, then reimagined myself as both a hero and a villain using AI. I also included a woven craft project I completed as a child, bringing in a physical memory of creativity. This project launched the semester by asking me to think deeply about how identity is portrayed, shaped, and remixed through digital storytelling.

## üîπ 2. A Day in My Life as an Educator

**Prompt:** Create a short comic that tells a story using AI-generated visuals and digital assembly tools.

This comic follows a day in my life as a teacher ‚Äî from the first sip of coffee to my students' curious conversations. I used ChatGPT to generate scenes, then stitched them into a visual narrative. This project helped me express the rhythm, joy, and purpose I feel in the classroom.
