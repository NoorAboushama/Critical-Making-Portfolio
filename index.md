# 📚 Critical Making Portfolio  
*Curated by Noor Aboushama*

This portfolio brings together a set of creative projects I worked on throughout the semester. Each one gave me a chance to try something new—whether that was coding an animation, designing a comic, or building a story map.

These projects pushed me to think differently about how we tell stories, use technology, and reflect on big ideas. Along the way, I was inspired by readings from Johnson and Salter, Sasha Costanza-Chock, and others who helped me see that making things can be a form of thinking and questioning.

Each project includes a short explanation and a reflection on how the readings shaped my process. I learned a lot by doing, and I’m excited to share what came out of that journey.

## 🔹 1. Reimagining the Self

### ✨ Project Description:
This project began as a selfie-based exploration of identity and evolved into a reflection on memory, perspective, and transformation. I used filters and AI tools to generate alternate versions of myself as a hero and a villain — acknowledging how we may be seen differently by others depending on their perspective. I also finished a childhood weaving project I had started in Egypt, turning it into a visual metaphor for who I was and who I’ve become.

### 📚 Theoretical Connection:
In *Selfie*, Johnson and Salter note that AI systems often reproduce stereotypes: “it reveals the biases in the underlying dataset.” I experienced this when the AI-generated heroes and villains didn’t reflect me culturally or personally. Returning to a craft I began as a child helped me counter that narrative and create a more honest self-portrait — one grounded in personal history rather than algorithmic assumption. Like Auerbach’s self-portraits, this project became less about surface and more about the story beneath.

## 🔹 2. A Day in My Life as an Educator

### ✨ Project Description:
For this project, I created a comic strip using ChatGPT and Canva to tell the story of a typical day in my life as a teacher. The process involved generating images, editing prompts, writing captions, and assembling everything into a final visual format. While the AI tools were helpful, they also revealed challenges — like stereotypical or incorrect visual representations — which I had to problem-solve along the way.

### 📚 Theoretical Connection:
In *Making Critical Making*, Garnet Hertz writes that “critical making is about hands-on physical work that has a clear place in enhancing and extending the process of critical reflection” (p. 5). This project was exactly that: a trial-and-error process that forced me to think about the moments I wanted to share, how I wanted to be represented, and how to bring those ideas to life digitally. Johnson and Salter echo this in *Comic*, writing that “The future of generative tools suggests even greater ease for would-be scholarly comic creators” (p. 64). With the help of AI, I was able to create something I wouldn’t have been able to draw by hand — a meaningful visual story that reflects both my work and my values.

## 🔹 3. I Am Hungry Too, Human

### ✨ Project Description:
This project started as a fun idea based on something real—how my cat always wants to eat whatever I’m eating. I found images online and used GIPHY to create a simple GIF that captures that everyday moment. The rainbow filter and caption added humor and a little storytelling to a very real part of my life with my pet.

### 📚 Theoretical Connection:
In *Critical Making in the Age of AI*, Johnson and Salter write that GIFs allow people to “provide heightened and layered communication, demonstrate cultural knowledge, and occasionally engage in displays of resistance” (p. 9). For me, the GIF was a playful way to connect emotion and visual storytelling. In *Your Computer Is on Fire*, Thomas S. Mullaney reminds us that we can’t view technology as neutral. Even creating something as light as a GIF involved making choices about representation and voice.

## 🔹 4. Mapping a Heroine’s Journey

### ✨ Project Description:
This project invited me to think about maps not just as tools for direction, but as tools for storytelling. I created an original narrative about Maya Rivera, a high school student who becomes an unlikely heroine during a statewide emergency in Florida. The story unfolded across multiple cities, from Orlando to Gainesville, and was mapped using Google Earth to show how her actions inspired a ripple effect of resilience and innovation.

### 📚 Theoretical Connection:
In *Visualizing Emancipation*, Nesbit and Ayers note that historical change “proceeded in patterns, not as a chaotic, secular rapture” (p. 2). That reminded me how Maya’s story unfolded in deliberate stages, each location adding emotional and practical depth. Johnson and Salter write that “every physical space we can inhabit holds layers of meaning for each of us” (p. 1). In this project, mapping allowed me to explore how setting and sequence can elevate a narrative — turning geography into metaphor. Each city in Maya’s journey wasn’t just a backdrop, but a reflection of progress: crisis, action, collaboration, and resolution. By placing each part of the story on the map, I could show how physical movement mirrored emotional and social growth. The map became a way to visualize change — both personal and collective — across time and place.

## 🔹 5. Remixing *Romeo and Juliet*

### ✨ Project Description:
As an English teacher currently teaching *Romeo and Juliet*, I wanted to explore how students could engage more deeply with the emotional heart of the play. This multimodal project used three creative formats: an interactive OpenProcessing sketch, a short comic strip, and a reimagined selfie of Romeo and Juliet if love had won instead of hate.

The rose and dagger sketch symbolized the core tension of the play—love and violence intertwined. The animation made those themes feel alive and dynamic. For the comic strip, I worked with ChatGPT to visually simplify five pivotal scenes, making Shakespeare more accessible for my English Language Learners. The final selfie imagined an alternate ending: Romeo and Juliet alive, smiling. That one image challenged everything we usually associate with the play’s tragic ending and gave me a new way to spark discussion in class.

### 🧩 OpenProcessing Code
This interactive sketch was created using P5.js and explores themes of love and violence in *Romeo and Juliet*.  
👉 **[View the full source code here](dagger_flower_sketch.js)**  

```javascript
let quotes = [
  "My only love sprung from my only hate.",
  "These violent delights have violent ends.",
  "Thus with a kiss I die.",
  "I defy you, stars!"
];

function mousePressed() {
  flash = !flash;
  currentQuote = (currentQuote + 1) % quotes.length;
}
```

### 📚 Theoretical Connection:
This project was deeply inspired by Sasha Costanza-Chock’s *Design Pedagogies*, which reminds us that “education is never neutral: it either maintains the current system of domination, or it is designed to liberate people.” That idea reshaped how I approached this project—not just as an assignment, but as a tool to co-create meaning with students.

In *Z^k: A Zettelkablooey*, Joshua Reinier writes, “It is a maze of linked and abbreviated ideas searching for coherence about itself, while that search only multiplies the glitches of the system.” That quote reassured me that it’s okay if creative teaching doesn’t always look perfect. Sometimes learning happens best when we explore messy, layered, emotional work—just like this remix of Shakespeare.

## 💭 Final Reflection  

This portfolio reminded me that making is about more than tools or tech — it’s about asking better questions, telling stories that matter, and making space for others to do the same. Whether I was coding a blooming rose or creating a classroom comic, I found that each project helped me reflect more deeply on who I am and how I teach.

As a current high school English teacher and future college educator, I plan to take many of these ideas into my own classroom. From visual storytelling to remixing classic texts, I want students to see themselves as co-creators of meaning—not just consumers of content.  

I’m excited to keep exploring what it means to teach and create critically in the age of AI.
